# Building Construction Time Lapse

## About

Back in the days when working in the office was still a thing, there was a new building getting constructed outside of the Micro Kitchen window at my office. Taking a picture of the construction site soon got into my coffee break routine, when I realized that I could make a cool time lapse movie out of these photos. From Dec 2018 to Feb 2020, I have taken 95 photos in total, which are enough to give a cool effect when I swipe through them in Apple Photos.

One of the issues I had was that even though all these photos are taken against the same window in the MK, each of them has a different translation along the x-axis and the y-axis. That inevitable error results in a shaky effect in the swipe-through. A couple of my friends who knows CV better suggested that I use something like a video stablier to de-shake the movie.

And therefore this repo. Some little scripts for processing the photos into a nice movie.

Final result:

Removing some of the blurry photos did make it better, but the video is still shaky towards the end ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
